\begin{abstract}
	The out-of-thin-air (OOTA) properties of the specification
	of \co{memory_order_relaxed} have resulted in considerable
	consternation over the years.
	Attempts to create memory models that rule out OOTA behaviors
	have either been non-executable, complex, or unloved by C++
	implementers.
	But at the same time, there are no known instances of OOTA
	behavior in real C++ implementations.

	This paper goes further, adding temporal constraints from
	long-standing laws of physics and constraints on hardware
	architecture and design, thereby providing an informal
	proof that OOTA cannot occur in correctly constructed C++
	programs running on real-world systems.

	The result is that a correct per-execution-path C++ implementation
	necessarily preserves the semantic dependencies that prevent
	OOTA cycles from forming.
	Implementations that undertake complex cross-thread analysis
	still need to be careful.
\end{abstract}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:Background}

This section provides a brief overview of the OOTA problem followed
by an equally brief summary of prior work in this area.

\subsection{Brief OOTA Overview}
\label{sec:Brief OOTA Overview}

OOTA occurs when a group of threads load from each others' stores,
but where each thread's store depends on the value returned by that
thread's load.
A given out-of-thin-air value passes around the resulting cycle.
Because there is a cycle, on a real system, at least one of the links
must be counter-temporal, that is, either a load returns a value before
that value is stored, or a store's address or value is computed before
a prior load returns a value used in that computation.

\begin{listing}[tbp]
@@ DisplayLitmus litmus/oota-ctrl.litmus @@
\caption{OOTA Cycle}
\label{lst:OOTA Cycle}
\end{listing}

Listing~\ref{lst:OOTA Cycle}
shows an OOTA cycle.
The first line identifies it as a C-language litmus test and gives it
a name.
Lines~2-5 initialize variables, in this case setting the initial
values of the global shared variables \co{x} and \co{y} to zero.
Lines~7-13 define the first process, \co{P0()}, and lines~15-21
define the second process, \co{P1()}.
The arguments to both \co{P0()} and \co{P1()} specify which of
the global shared variables each process may access.
In this case, both processes may access both \co{x} and \co{y}.
The body of each process specifies a limited subset of C++ code,
which also happens to be a somewhat less limited subset of C code.

Finally, line~23 specifies an \co{exists} clause, which gives a
condition to check for the final value of the specified local
variables.
The \co{0:} prefix specifies a variable local to \co{P0()} and
the \co{1:} prefix specifies a variable local to \co{P1()}.
The \co{/\\} specifies a boolean AND, and the \co{=} specifies
an equality comparison.

\caption{OOTA Cycle, \co{herd7} Output}
\label{lst:OOTA Cycle, herd7 Output}
\end{listing}

Line~4 of the corresponding output of the \co{herd7} tool shows the
counterintuitive outcome where both processes load the value 42.
As we will see, this outcome is not possible in real-world implementations
due to physical constraints of which \co{herd7} is (by design) unaware.

Note that C++ implementations are permitted to evaluate to a more
general notion of OOTA values in cases involving unspecified or undefined
behavior, such as use of uninitialized objects.
However, these situations do not involve OOTA cycles, but rather user
errors and other issues that can lead to unfriendly optimizations that
in turn result in unpredictable output.
This paper focuses instead on OOTA cycles.

\subsection{Prior Work}
\label{sec:Prior Work}

All OOTA workers owe a debt to the foundational work in the infamous
``Causality Test Cases'',\footnote{
	\url{http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/unifiedProposal/testcases.html}.}
which may be found in
Appendix~\ref{app:Litmus Tests from “Causality Test Cases"}.

Some executable C++ memory models correctly flagged executions involving
OOTA~\cite{JadeAlglave2014HerdingCats}.\footnote{
	Others cleverly avoid this issue by forbidding atomic
	stores of non-constant values~\cite{MarkBatty2011cppmem}.}
% @@@ Better herd7 C11 citation?
However, because these models are atemporal, they cannot reject
OOTA executions other than by flagging the OOTA value as arbitrary
(which some in fact do in at least some cases).

P0442R0 (``Out-of-Thin-Air Execution is Vacuous'')~\cite{PaulEMcKenney2016OOTA}
provided a decision procedure for classifying behaviors as permitted
misordering on the one hand or disallowed OOTA on the other, using
a perturbation method based on the insight that all OOTA behaviors are
fixed-point computations.

Some workers recommend avoiding OOTA by ordering prior relaxed
loads before subsequent relaxed
stores~\cite{Boehm:2014:OGA:2618128.2618134,HansBoehm2019OOTArevisitedAgain,Lahav:2017:RSC:3062341.3062352},
but this requires real instructions be executed, consuming real
time and real electrical power to solve a strictly theoretical
problem.

Other workers recommend various procedures to identify and avoid OOTA
cycles~\cite{Lahav:2017:RSC:3062341.3062352,Sinclair:2017:CAR:3079856.3080206,Lee:10.1145/3385412.3386010,MarkBatty2019ModularRelaxedDependenciesOOTA},
but none of these have been looked upon favorably by C++ implementers.

All this work focused on either identifying OOTA or on how C++
implementations could avoid it.
None of this work applied real-world temporal constraints to the OOTA
problem.
Which might explain why no known real-world C++ implementation results
in OOTA executions.

This paper therefore drops the question of how OOTA can be avoided and
instead focuses on proving that OOTA cannot occur.

\subsection{OOTA Definition}
\label{sec:OOTA Definition}

Prior work defines ``OOTA cycle'' by example, without a precise
definition.
Sometimes ``causal cycle'' is used as if it was a definition, but
without a clear decision process for what does and does not
constitute a causal cycle.
P0442R0 defines an OOTA cycle as a fixed-point computation that is
destroyed by perturbations, which makes perfect sense to that paper's
authors, but has left others unsatisfied.

The C++ standard says this in 33.5.4p8
(\co{[atomics.order]})~\cite{ThomasKoeppe2023N4950}:

\begin{quote}
	Implementations should ensure that no “out-of-thin-air” values
	are computed that circularly depend on their own computation.
\end{quote}

Others, current authors included, have define an OOTA cycle as a
cycle in sdep $\cup$ rf, where sdep is the set of semantic
dependencies within each thread and rf is the set of store-to-load
links, whether intra-thread or between threads.
This is a fine definition, and is consistent with the words in the C++
standard, except that it simply shunts all the complexity into the
term ``semantic dependency''.

We could follow this long-established tradition of proposing
solutions to the OOTA problem without a definition of this problem.
However, we (perhaps foolishly) felt the need to provide a clear
definition,

We therefore define an OOTA cycle (also known as a causal cycle) as a
cycle in the memory-model sense involving only reads-from links, that
is, the value stored in on thread being read by the next thread.
Within each thread in the cycle, the value stored depends on
the value loaded.
This dependency might be a control dependency
(see Listing~\ref{lst:OOTA Cycle})
or it might be a data dependency
(see Listing~\ref{lst:Causality Test Case 4} on
page~\pageref{lst:Causality Test Case 4}).\footnote{
	Sufficiently motivated readers should have no problem constructing
	examples involving address dependencies.}
@@@ There must be at least two distinct values such that if a given load
returns a given value, that value forces the cycle to execute so as to
cause the corresponding store's value to be equal to that given value, and
for that store to occur early enough for the load to return that value.

\section{Real-World Constraints}
\label{sec:Real-World Constraints}

Real-world constraints are imposed by the standard, which have been
considered in prior work, and by the laws of physics, which have
not.
Additional constraints are imposed by hardware architecture and
design, which have been partially accounted for in the standard,
one limitation being that accurate and executable formal descriptions
of hardware memory models did not appear until after the standard
was released.
A final set of constraints is imposed by the C++ implementations
themselves.

The following sections discuss these constraints, starting with the
laws of physics, continuing with hardware constraints, continuing
further with constraints imposed by the standard, and culminating
with constraints imposed by the C++ implementations themselves.

\subsection{Laws of Physics}
\label{sec:Laws of Physics}

Evidence to date suggests that the universe is
causal~\cite{Plato360BC-causality},
the speed of light is finite~\cite{OleRoemer1671SpeedOfLight}, and
atoms are of non-zero size~\cite{JeanBaptistePerrin1923AtomSize}.
These fundamental laws of physics are empirical in nature, but
are backed by a great many observations extending back to a time
preceding electronic computers, let alone computer languages that
support concurrency.

The relationship between these three laws of physics and OOTA
cycles is described in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Causality}
\label{sec:Causality}

Plato's ``Timaeus'' notwithstanding, there has been much recent debate
as to whether the universe is in fact causal with cause necessarily
preceding effect.
However, no one has managed to construct a real time-travel machine
or any other apparatus that might result in effect preceding cause,
as discussed at length in the Wikipedia article on retrocausality and
its many references.\footnote{
	\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality}.}

This paper will therefore assume that effect cannot precede cause in
any real-world computing system.

\subsubsection{Finite Speed of Light}
\label{sec:Finite Speed of Light}

If the speed of light was infinite, then information could be transmitted
at infinite speed, arriving at any destination, no matter how remote,
in zero time.
This situation would permit a load to return the value stored by some
other thread at the exact instant that the store executed, which
would in turn remove propagation delay as a factor preventing
causal loops such as OOTA cycles from forming.

However, all macroscopic measurements to date have shown the speed of
light to be finite, thus preventing causal loops based on infinite-speed
propagation of information.

This paper will therefore assume that the speed of light is finite, and
thus the maximum speed at which information can propagate is also finite.

\subsubsection{Non-Zero Sized Atoms}
\label{sec:Non-Zero Sized Atoms}

If atoms were of zero size, a zero-sized computer might be constructed.
In such a computer, even give finite speed of light, information could
propagate among computing elements in zero time.
This situation would also permit a load to return the value stored by
some other thread at the exact instant that the store executed, which
would again in turn remove propagation delay as a factor preventing
causal loops such as OOTA cycles from forming.

However, there has to date been no successful attempt to construct a
zero-sized computing device capable of running non-trivial C++ programs.

This paper will therefore assume that any computing device capable of
running C++ will be of non-zero size.

\subsubsection{Laws of Physics: Consequences}
\label{sec:Laws of Physics: Consequences}

These three laws of physics mean that if one thread loads the value
stored by some other thread, that load must have occurred later
in global time than did the store.
In other words, the reads-from relation is temporal in nature.

In contrast, the C++11 modification-order relation is atemporal,
because computing systems can and observably do determine the
modification order of a set of concurrent stores long after the fact.
This means that the store that executed earlier in global time
might appear later in the stored-to object's modification
order~\cite{McKenney20xxParallelProgramming}.
The atemporal nature of C++11 modification order is due to the hardware
store-buffer optimizations used by modern multicore systems.

This atemporality is also why cycles are not considered to have
OOTA cycles when at least one link from one thread to the next
involves both threads storing to the same object.
Similarly, cycles having at least link where one thread loads from an
object and the next thread stores to that object are also not considered
to be OOTA cycles.

Current programming-language abstract machines do not capture these
temporal constraints, which makes it more difficult for them to
efficiently rule out OOTA behavior.

\subsection{Hardware Architecture and Design}
\label{sec:Hardware Architecture and Design}

In happy contrast to the situation at the start of the C++11 memory-model
effort, heavily used CPU families now have accurate and executable formal
memory models, all of which prohibit the causal cycles required to form
OOTA cycles.
Even more important, there is clarity on exactly what hardware can and
can not do in the course of speculative execution.
Finally, computation is based on instructions, and instructions require
finite time to execute, even when executed speculatively.

\begin{listing}[tbp]
\begin{verbatim}
 1 int foo(int i) {
 2   atomic_int x = 0;
 3   int y[3];
 4   volatile int r1;
 5   {{{ { y[i].store(42, memory_order_relaxed);
 6         x.store(1, memory_order_relaxed); }
 7   ||| r1 = x.load(memory_order_relaxed);
 8   }}};
 9   return 0;
10 }
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Speculated Store and Non-Speculated Load}
\label{lst:Speculated Store and Non-Speculated Load}
\end{listing}

For example, in Listing~\ref{lst:Speculated Store and Non-Speculated Load},
suppose that the storage for \co{x} is located immediately before that
for \co{a[]}.
Suppose further that hardware speculation incorrectly guesses the value
of \co{i} to be -1, so that the speculated store of 42 on line~5 uses
the address of \co{x}.\footnote{
	Yes, \co{y[-1]} is undefined behavior, but the CPU neither knows
	nor cares, nor should it.}
Then line~7 can cause the final value of \co{r1} to be 42, when
by the rules of the C++ abstract machine the value must instead be
either zero or one.

Therefore, non-speculative loads are prohibited from loading values from
speculative stores.

As a special case of this prohibition, a value stored speculatively must
not be exposed to non-speculative loads from other threads.
In the further special case of multiple hardware threads sharing a core,
one might imagine speculation involving multiple threads.
However, in this case, any squashing of speculation must squash the
full extent of that speculation, across all of the hardware threads
that were involved.

Applying this to Listing~\ref{lst:OOTA Cycle}, because values from
speculative stores cannot be visible to non-speculative loads, lines~10
and~12 cannot be committed until after the load in line~8 completes
and the conditional on line~9 is evaluated non-speculatively.\footnote{
	Alternatively, one could imagine that both the speculation
	and the squashing of failed speculation might span multiple
	threads.}
Similarly, lines~18 and~20 cannot be committed until after lines~16
and~17 complete non-speculatively.

Note that if both legs of the \co{if} statement spanning lines~9-12 were
to store the same value, the implementation would be within its rights
to hoist the store out of that \co{if} statement.
However, in this case, the two stores on lines~10 and~12 are storing
distinct values, preventing the hoisting.

Note also that some architectures provide conditional-move instructions,
which allows line~7 to avoid emitting a conditional branch.
However, such architectures would still treat a store of the
target of the conditional-move instructions as speculative until
such time as the conditional moves (and any loads that they depend
on) complete.

Finally, the prohibition of hardware OOTA applies within a single
multi-threaded core as well as between cores.
This means that for any set of speculative accesses to be committed,
all loads in that set must have been confirmed by corresponding
non-speculative stores.

\subsection{Constraints of the Standard}
\label{sec:Constraints of the Standard}

Because volatile atomics constitute observable
behavior~\cite[\co{intro.abstract}]{ThomasKoeppe2023N4950},
they must be executed in strict accordance with the rules of the abstract
machine.
This means that any volatile atomic operation involving a store
must execute as if all loads whose return values are used to compute
that store's address or value have already returned.
OOTA afficienados will recognize this as a special case of ordering
relaxed loads before relaxed stores, albeit one not requiring
expensive memory-fence instructions on weakly ordered architectures.

Although C++ non-volatile accesses to atomic objects are not observable
behavior, they are still subject to the memory model.
In particular, implementations must not behave as if the source code has
additional:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Invented atomic stores.
\item	Duplicated atomic stores.
\end{enumerate}

The discussion of these two constraints is followed by a discussion of
when redundant atomic stores may safely be omitted.

\paragraph{Invented Atomic Stores}

\begin{listing}[tbp]
\begin{verbatim}
 1 int main() {
 2   atomic_int x = 2;
 3   volatile int r1;
 4   {{{ { x.store(42, memory_order_relaxed); // invented store
 5         x.store(3, memory_order_relaxed); }
 6   ||| r1 = x.load(memory_order_relaxed);
 7   }}};
 8   return 0;
 9 }
\end{verbatim}
\caption{CPPMEM Invented Store}
\label{lst:CPPMEM Invented Store}
\end{listing}

The reason that atomic stores cannot be invented is that doing so can
introduce new (and almost certainly undesirable) behaviors that are
forbidden by the abstract machine.
To see this, consider Listing~\ref{lst:CPPMEM Invented Store},
a CPPMEM\footnote{
	\url{http://svr-pes20-cppmem.cl.cam.ac.uk/cppmem/index.html}.}
litmus test that demonstrates such a behavior.
Without line~4, only the values~2 and~3 can be stored to \co{r1}.
With that line, the additional value~42 can also be stored to \co{r1}.
The implementation is therefore forbidded from inventing that store of 42
unless it can prove that doing so does not negatively affect the
program's observable behaviors, independently of OOTA cycles.
For example, the implementation might be able to prove that there
are no other accesses to \co{x} at the time of the invented store.

\paragraph{Duplicated Atomic Stores}

\begin{listing}[tbp]
\begin{verbatim}
 1 int main() {
 2   atomic_int x = 0;
 3   volatile int r1;
 4   {{{ { x.store(1, memory_order_relaxed); // duplicated store
 5         x.store(1, memory_order_relaxed); }
 6   ||| { r1 = x.load(memory_order_relaxed);
 7         x.store(2, memory_order_relaxed); }
 8   }}};
 9   return 0;
10 }
\end{verbatim}
\caption{CPPMEM Duplicated Store}
\label{lst:CPPMEM Duplicated Store}
\end{listing}

Duplicating atomic stores can also introduce new and undesireable
behaviors.
To see this, consider Listing~\ref{lst:CPPMEM Duplicated Store}, a CPPMEM
litmus test that demonstrates such a behavior.
Without line~4, if the final value of \co{r1} is 1, then the final value
of \co{x} must be 2.
With that line, the final value of \co{x} can be 1 even when the
final value of \co{r1} is 1.
The implementation is therefore forbidden from duplicating that store of 1
unless it can prove that doing so does not negatively affect the
program's observable behaviors, independently of OOTA cycles.
Again, the implementation might be able to prove that there
are no other accesses to \co{x} at the time of the invented store.

\paragraph{Omitted Redundant Atomic Stores}
In contrast, a pair of back-to-back non-volatile atomic stores to \co{x}
might always be executed such that no other thread accesses \co{x}
during the time between those two stores.
This means that, if the implementation acted as if the store was omitted
from the source, the user would have no way to prove that fact short of
inspecting the assembly code.
In cases where such omissions are undesirable, the user can resort to
volatile atomic stores or to inline assembly\footnote{
	For example, by placing the Linux-kernel \co{barrier()} macro
	between the two stores.
	This macro is an empty GCC \co{asm} that specifies the \co{memory}
	clobber.}
to prevent the implementation from omitting a store.
However, acting as if such a redundant store was omitted from the source
code cannot create an OOTA cycle because any valid execution (OOTA or not)
of the program with the first of a back-to-back pair of non-volatile
relaxed atomic stores omitted is essentially a valid execution of the
program with the store present.

\subsection{C++ Implementations}
\label{sec:C++ Implementations}

C++ implementations execute C++ programs, and use a range of techniques.
For example, many implementations take steps to optimize the code to
be executed.
This optimization presents a trade-off between the time spent optimizing
the code and the time spent actually executing it.
One type of optimization is the identification of non-semantic dependencies
and the replacement of them with simpler computations, up to and including
replacement of arbitrarily complex passages of code with constants.\footnote{
	There are a great many other optimizations, but this paper
	necessarily focuses on semantic dependencies.}

This optimization process may, roughly speaking, be divided into two
activities, analysis of the code and classification of dependencies.

\subsubsection{Code Analysis}
\label{sec:Code Analysis}

As would be expected given the various optimization/execution tradeoffs,
different C++ implementations carry out different degrees of analysis.

First, at one extreme, ``simple implementations'' do absolutely no
analysis beyond that absolutely required to correctly execute the program.

Second, other implementations do local analysis.
This analysis might be on a per-code-path basis, within a single function,
within a single function after inlining, and so forth.

Third, one could imagine implementations whose analysis is restricted to
a thread.
In this case, the analysis stops at loads to objects that were last
stored to by other threads (``rfe''), stores to objects where the next
and/or previous stores in that object's modification order were executed
by other threads (``coe'')), and loads from objects for which the value
returned by a given load was overwritten by some other thread (``fre'').

Fourth, one could also imagine implementations whose analysis is
completely unrestricted, up to and including the limiting case where
execution is oracular in nature.
Of course, if we are going to imagine omniscient analysis and oracles,
we can also rely on them to locate any OOTA cycles that might appear
in environments not constrained by the laws of physics, hardware
limitations, and C++ implementation concerns.

However, for more realistic implementations in the third category,
analysis relevant to OOTA cycles begins with loads from objects that were
last stored to by some other thread and ends with stores to objects that
might be loaded by other threads.

If additional inter-thread information is available, the corresponding
constraints may be applied.
For example, if an implementation determines that the values of a pair
of objects are always equal at any time that a given thread might access
them, one could imagine a sufficiently brave implementation substituting
a load from one for a load from the other.

The next section focuses on the key analysis step for OOTA cycles,
namely dependency classification.

\subsubsection{Dependency Classification}
\label{sec:Dependency Classification}

Carrying out this type of optimization requires that the implementation
classify dependencies as semantic or not.
Given the limited resources available, almost all implementations will
choose to approximate sdep, which entails some misclassifications, with
the consequences summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:Semantic-Dependency Classification}.
The first row of the table depicts the case where the implementation
correctly identifies a semantic dependency, and thus exhibits temporal
behavior for the corresponding code.
The second row depicts the case where the implementation misclassifies
the dependency as non-semantic, which will result in an incorrect
execution.
In this case, the proper course of action is to fix that bug.
The third row depicts the case where the implementation misclassifies
the dependency as semantic, thus missing a chance to optimize.
The resulting execution is nevertheless correct, and is also temporal.
The fourth and final row depicts the case where the implementation
correctly classifies the dependency as non-semantic, in which case
the execution is both correct and atemporal.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|l}
Actual Code	& Implementation	& Result \\
\hline
sdep		& sdep			& Temporal \\
\cline{2-3}
		& $\neg$sdep		& BUG!!! \\
\hline
$\neg$sdep	& sdep			& Temporal \\
\cline{2-3}
		& $\neg$sdep		& Atemporal \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Semantic-Dependency Classification}
\label{tab:Semantic-Dependency Classification}
\end{table}

Note well that in the absence of bugs in the implementation (which
again should be fixed), it is the implementation's classification of
the dependency that dictates whether or not the corresponding execution
is temporal.

Therefore, in the limiting case, analyses of OOTA cycles that focus on a
given implementation can simply use that implementation's classification
of dependencies as semantic on the one hand or non-semantic on the other.
While taking this approach sacrifices significant generality, it has the
benefit of greatly reduces the cost of dependency analysis, potentially
to zero.

\section{How to Form an OOTA Cycle?}
\label{sec:How to Form an OOTA Cycle?}

Rather than look at how to prevent an implementation from forming
an OOTA cycle, this section instead looks at how to form one.
This will lead to the conclusion that a correct C++ implementation
cannot form an OOTA cycle.

Again, an OOTA cycle consists of loads from other threads' stores where
a given store's address or value depends on the value returned by
the corresponding thread's prior load.
All of the links from ont thread to the next are reads-from links, which
are temporal in nature, that is, a given store must execute earlier in
global time than any load from that stored-to object that returns the
value stored.

And again, an OOTA cycle must have at least one link that goes backwards
in time.
The only possible candidate counter-temporal links so are those
confined to a given thread.
This in turn requires that a store that depends on an earlier load
be executed earlier in time than that load.
The two ways that this can happen are when the implementation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Is able to determine (prove) the location and value of the store.
\item	Guesses the location and value of the store and has some means
	to take corrective action should any guess prove incorrect.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these possibilities is discussed in the next sections.
followed by a section on the possibility of flattening a multithreaded
program into a single thread.

\subsection{Implementation Proves Value}
\label{sec:Implementation Proves Value}

Implementation can sometimes prove the location and value of a given
store.
For example, if the value loaded is multiplied by zero, the result
is known to be zero, so that the store can proceed prior to the load.
But in this case, there is no perturbation of the value returned from
the load that can affect the value stored.
Therefore, by P0442R0, that store cannot possibly take part in an
OOTA cycle.

\subsection{Implementation Guesses at Value}
\label{sec:Implementation Guesses at Value}

Hardware speculative execution is commonplace, and permits the
hardware to guess at values, squashing the speculation if any
of the guesses prove incorrect.
But in this case, a given store is not committed until all guesses that
this store depends on have been confirmed, and thus no uncommitted store
is visible to any other thread.
Therefore, hardware speculation cannot result in OOTA cycles, and
by design, even on weakly ordered
systems~\cite{ARMv7A:2010,ARMv8A:2017,PowerISA2.07-2013}.
This same constraint applies to software, which might use compare-and-swap
loops or hardware transactional memory to confirm guesses.

Either way, the need to wait for guesses to be confirmed before committing
stores prevents those stores from becoming visible prior to the
completion of any loads that those stores depend on.

\subsection{But What About Flattening?}
\label{sec:But What About Flattening?}

The concept of flattening multiple threads into a single thread is
tantalizing, especially given the large cache-miss penalties inherent
to large multicore systems, which can have many sockets containing
thousands of CPUs.
One might object to the whole concept of flattening as an
optimization given the difficulty inherent in avoiding deadlocks
and other hazards.
Nevertheless, it is only reasonable to ask whether flattening can
result in OOTA cycles.
As we will see, the answer is ``no''.

But for the purposes of OOTA cycles, the flattening situation is
much simpler.
Any fully flattened program will be single threaded, which implies that
each of its atomic load operations will return the last value stored to
that same object in sequenced-before order (or the initial value if there
is no such store).
Thus, any sequence of loads and stores must have a first operation and
a last operation, and the last operation cannot affect the first
operation.
Therefore, cycles cannot possibly form in a flattened program,
which in turn implies that OOTA cycles cannot form.

\subsection{Correct Implementations Cannot Form OOTA Cycles}
\label{sec:Correct Implementations Cannot Form OOTA Cycles}

This section has shown that an implementation that correctly
handles the memory model, observable behavior, and the as-if rule
cannot form OOTA cycles.

\section{Suggested Changes to Wording}
\label{sec:Suggested Changes to Wording}

Add the following note in \co{[atomics.order]} after 33.5.4p9:

\begin{quote}
	[ \emph{Note:} Implementations that respect the following
	constraints are incapable of computing out-of-thin-air value
	that depend circularly on their own computation:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item	Correctly implement the C++ abstract machine, and
	\item	Run on correctly implemented hardware
		(specifically, hardware that forbids non-speculative
		loads from returning values from speculative stores
		and that forbids exposing values from speculative
		stores to other threads), and
	\item	Reside in a universe having a finite speed of light
		and atomic matter.
	\end{itemize}

	All three constraints are subject to the as-if rule.
	For example, those creating an alternate universe in which
	C++ implementations are to run correctly should ensure
	that their universe behaves as if the speed of light was
	finite and the nature of matter was atomic.
	--- \emph{end note} ]
\end{quote}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

This paper has added temporal reasoning to OOTA analysis of the C++
memory model.
This work shows that correct C++ implementations are inherently incapable
of producing OOTA cycles.

Therefore, if your C++ implementation produces OOTA cycles, you have
bugs that would be considered bugs even if OOTA cycles were allowed.
And you need to fix those bugs, regardless of whether they are in your
C++ implementation, your hardware, or your alternative universe.

is to be allowed.
However, the \co{herd7} tool does not find this litmus test's cycle, presumably
because this tool does not do the deep inter-thread program analysis
required to find it.
