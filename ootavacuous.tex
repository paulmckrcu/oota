\begin{abstract}
	The out-of-thin-air (OOTA) properties of the specification
	of \co{memory_order_relaxed} have resulted in considerable
	consternation over the years.
	Attempts to create memory models that rule out OOTA behaviors
	have either been non-executable, complex, or unloved by C++
	implementers.
	But at the same time, there are no known instances of OOTA
	behavior in real C++ implementations.

	This paper refactors the commonly used condition for detecting
	OOTA behavior, which permits bringing to bear constraints from
	long-standing laws of physics and on hardware systems.
	These constraints prevent OOTA from occurring in correctly
	constructed C++ programs running on correctly constructed C++
	implementations in our current universe.

	In this, OOTA behaviors are similar to the issues surrounding
	undecidability and its real-world counterpart, high complexity.
	So similar, in fact, that not only the same strategies apply
	to OOTA, but also the same \emph{code} applies, both for C++
	implementations and for associated tooling.
\end{abstract}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:Background}

This section provides a brief overview of the OOTA problem, followed
by an equally brief summary of prior work in this area, and ending
with a quick review of a few of the challenges for general definitions of
``OOTA cycle''.

\subsection{Brief OOTA Overview}
\label{sec:Brief OOTA Overview}

OOTA occurs when a group of threads load from each others' stores,
but where each thread's store depends on the value returned by that
thread's load.
A given out-of-thin-air value passes around the resulting cycle.
Because there is a cycle, on a real system, at least one of the links
must be atemporal, that is, either a load returns a value before
that value is stored, or a store's address or value is computed before
a prior load returns a value used in that computation.

\label{lst:OOTA Cycle}
\end{listing}

Listing~\ref{lst:OOTA Cycle}
shows an OOTA cycle.
The first line identifies it as a C-language litmus test and gives it
a name.
Lines~2-5 initialize variables, in this case setting the initial
values of the global shared variables \co{x} and \co{y} to zero.
Lines~7-13 define the first process, \co{P0()}, and lines~15-21
define the second process, \co{P1()}.
The arguments to both \co{P0()} and \co{P1()} specify which of
the global shared variables each process may access.
In this case, both processes may access both \co{x} and \co{y}.
The body of each process specifies a limited subset of C++ code,
which also happens to be a somewhat less limited subset of C code.

Finally, line~23 specifies an \co{exists} clause, which gives a
condition to check for the final value of the specified local
variables.
The \co{0:} prefix specifies a variable local to \co{P0()} and
the \co{1:} prefix specifies a variable local to \co{P1()}.
The \co{/\\} specifies a boolean AND, and the \co{=} specifies
an equality comparison.

Listing~\ref{lst:OOTA Cycle, herd7 Output} shows the corresponding output
of the \co{herd7} tool.
Lines~3 and~4 show the possible states, with line~4 showing the
counterintuitive outcome where both processes load the value 42.
As we will see, this outcome is not possible in real-world implementations
due to physical constraints of which \co{herd7} is (by design) unaware.
Line~9 contains \co{Sometimes} (as opposed to \co{Never} or \co{Always}),
indicating that some executions satisfy the \co{exists} clause and
others do not.

Other OOTA-related litmus tests may be found in
Appendix~\ref{app:OOTA-Related Litmus Tests}.

Note that C++ implementations are permitted to evaluate to a more
general notion of OOTA values in cases involving unspecified or undefined
behavior (UB), such as use of uninitialized objects.
However, these situations do not involve OOTA cycles, but rather user
errors and other issues that can lead to unfriendly optimizations that
in turn result in unpredictable output.
This paper focuses instead on OOTA cycles.

\subsection{Prior Work}
\label{sec:Prior Work}

All OOTA workers owe a debt to the foundational work in the infamous
``Causality Test Cases'',\footnote{
	\url{http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/unifiedProposal/testcases.html}.}
which may be found in
Appendix~\ref{app:Litmus Tests from “Causality Test Cases"}.

Some executable C++ memory models correctly flag at least some executions
involving OOTA cycles~\cite{JadeAlglave2014HerdingCats}.\footnote{
	Others cleverly avoid this issue by forbidding atomic
	stores of non-constant values~\cite{MarkBatty2011cppmem}.}
% @@@ Better herd7 C11 citation?
However, because these models are atemporal, they cannot reject
OOTA executions other than by flagging the OOTA value as arbitrary,
which some in fact do in at least some cases.

P0442R0 (``Out-of-Thin-Air Execution is Vacuous'')~\cite{PaulEMcKenney2016OOTA}
provided a decision procedure for classifying behaviors as permitted
misordering on the one hand or disallowed OOTA on the other, using
a perturbation method based on the insight that all OOTA behaviors are
fixed-point computations.

Some workers recommend avoiding OOTA by ordering prior relaxed
loads before subsequent relaxed
stores~\cite{Boehm:2014:OGA:2618128.2618134,HansBoehm2019OOTArevisitedAgain,Lahav:2017:RSC:3062341.3062352},
but this requires real instructions be executed, consuming real
time and real electrical power to solve a strictly theoretical
problem.

Other workers recommend various procedures to identify and avoid OOTA
cycles~\cite{Lahav:2017:RSC:3062341.3062352,Sinclair:2017:CAR:3079856.3080206,Lee:10.1145/3385412.3386010,MarkBatty2019ModularRelaxedDependenciesOOTA},
but none of these have been looked upon favorably by C++ implementers.

Goldblatt looked at interactions between OOTA cycles and
UB~\cite{DavidGoldblatt2019NoElegantOOTAfix}.
Appendix~\ref{app:Aside on Undefined Behavior}
analyzes the examples and notes ways to separate UB and OOTA-cycle
concerns.
The remainder of this document will focus on examples lacking UB.

All this work focused on either identifying OOTA or on how C++
implementations could avoid it.
None of this work applied real-world temporal constraints to the OOTA
problem.
Which might explain why no known real-world C++ implementation results
in OOTA executions.

This paper therefore drops the question of how OOTA can be avoided and
instead focuses on proving that OOTA cannot occur.

\subsection{On OOTA Definitions}
\label{sec:On OOTA Definitions}

Prior work defines ``OOTA cycle'' by example, without a precise
definition.
Sometimes ``causal cycle'' is used as if it was a definition, but
without a clear decision process for what does and does not
constitute a causal cycle.
P0442R0 defines an OOTA cycle as a fixed-point computation that is
destroyed by perturbations, which makes perfect sense to that paper's
authors, but has left others unsatisfied.
Still others argue (perhaps correctly) that it is impossible to provide
a general definition of ``OOTA cycle'', but even accepting this raises
the question of whether a \emph{useful} definition can be formulated.

The C++ standard says this in 33.5.4p8
(\co{[atomics.order]})~\cite{ThomasKoeppe2023N4950}:

\begin{quote}
	Implementations should ensure that no “out-of-thin-air” values
	are computed that circularly depend on their own computation.
\end{quote}

Others have defined an OOTA cycle as a cycle in sdep $\cup$ rf, where
sdep is the set of semantic dependencies within each thread and rf is
the set of store-to-load links, whether intra-thread (rfi) or between
threads (rfe).\footnote{
	See Appendix~\ref{app:Inter-Process Communications} for definitions
	and properies of rf, rfe, and rfi.}
This is a fine definition, and is consistent with the words in the C++
standard, except that it simply shunts all the complexity onto the
term ``semantic dependency''.

The current authors deviate slightly from this tradition by instead
defining an OOTA cycle as a cycle in sdep $\cup$ rfe (or
\co{acyclic(sdep ; rfe)} in \co{herd7} notation), where rfe is the
set of store-to-load links, but excluding intra-thread rfi links, which
are instead considered to be part of sdep.
Although this does shunt even more complexity onto the term
``semantic dependency'', it also enables us to bring to bear
laws of physics and properties of hardware onto correct real-world
C++ implementations.% \footnote{
%	Thanks to Alan Stern for providing a litmus test that demonstrated
%	that we had unwittingly (but productively!) shifted our definition
%	to sdep $\cup$ rfe.}

The following sections discuss properties of and constraints on
useful definitions of ``semantic dependency''.

\subsubsection{Semantic Dependencies Are Per Execution}
\label{sec:Semantic Dependencies Are Per Execution}

One aspect of this complexity is the fact that semantic dependencies
are a function not strictly of the source code, but of a particular
execution.
Consider for example:

\begin{quote}
	\co{x = y * z;}
\end{quote}

There is a semantic dependency from \co{y} to \co{x} if and only if the
value of \co{z} is non-zero.
Otherwise, in the absence of observable behavior (such as volatile
accesses), the implementation is within its rights to discard this
statement and act as if later accesses to \co{x} were instead the
constant zero, at least up to the next assignment to \co{x}.

Consider also:

\begin{quote}
	\co{x = y + z;}
\end{quote}

There is a semantic dependency from both \co{y} and \co{z} if and only
if these values do not cancel.
However, if the implementation knows that the value of \co{y} is always
the negative of \co{x}, there is no semantic dependency and the
implementation can again act as if later accesses to \co{x} were
instead the constant zero.

Finally, consider this:

\begin{quote}
	\co{r1 = x;} \\
	\co{if (r1 > 0)} \\
	\co{\ \ \ \ y = r1;} \\
	\co{else} \\
	\co{\ \ \ \ z = r1;}
\end{quote}

Here there is a semantic dependency from \co{x}, but in some executions
it extends to \co{y} and in others to \co{z}.
This is an example of the load affecting not the value or address of
a given store, but rather whether or not that store is executed at all.

But beware of this example:

\begin{quote}
	\co{r1 = x;} \\
	\co{if (r1 > 0)} \\
	\co{\ \ \ \ y = 42;} \\
	\co{else} \\
	\co{\ \ \ \ y = 42;}
\end{quote}

Because the stores executed on each branch of that "if" statement
store identical values to identical addresses, they are for all intents
and purposes the same store.
Therefore, there is no semantic dependency~\cite{Howells2009membartxt}.

These examples demonstrate a key point: Although in some cases sdep can
be a strict function of the source code, \emph{in general, sdep must be
defined on a per-execution basis}.% \footnote{
% 	Thanks to Alan Stern for the examples in this section and
% 	in the preceding one.}

\subsubsection{Semantic Dependencies Can Be Nondeterministic}
\label{sec:Semantic Dependencies Can Be Nondeterministic}

Consider this example, with \co{i} initially zero:

\begin{quote}
	\co{y = ++i / ++i;} \\
	\co{x = y * z;}
\end{quote}

The standard does not specify the order of evaluation, so the resulting
value of \co{y} might be zero ($\frac{1}{2}$ truncated) or two
($\frac{2}{1}$).
In the former case, there is no semantic dependency from \co{z} to
\co{x}, but in the latter case there is.
Thus, semantic dependencies are not just a function of a particular
execution through the source code, but also of arbitrary choices made
by the C++ implementation.\footnote{
	Thanks to Peter Sewell for pointing out this possibility.}

Note well that C++ implementations can and do act as if portions of
the source code was duplicated in order to apply specialization
optimizations, in which case any nondeterminism might also be
duplicated.

Many projects' coding guidelines prohibit side effects in expressions,
their goal being to obtain portable code whose behavior does not depend
on arbitrary choices on the part of the implementation.
However, the above code nevertheless conforms to the standard.

\subsubsection{Semantic Dependencies And Optimization}
\label{sec:Semantic Dependencies And Optimization}

But suppose that the implementation can prove that at any time that
the above statement might execute, \co{y} is equal to \co{z}?
That would allow the implementation to optimize, that is, to act as if
the source code was instead as follows:

\begin{quote}
	\co{x = 2 * y;}
\end{quote}

Or equally valid:

\begin{quote}
	\co{x = 2 * z;}
\end{quote}

In this case, is the semantic dependency from \co{y} to \co{x},
from \co{z} to \co{x}, or both \co{y} and \co{z} to \co{x}?
The answer is that this is a free choice on the part of the
implementation.

\subsubsection{Semantic Dependencies and I/O}
\label{sec:Semantic Dependencies and I/O}

A computation might include I/O:

\begin{quote}
	\co{x = y * input_int();}
\end{quote}

Then there is a semantic dependency from \co{y} to \co{x} only if
the number input is non-zero.
Similar issues arise when reading timestamps.

In addition, I/O operations are observed behavior, which greatly restricts
optimizations involving them.

\subsubsection{Semantic Dependencies Can Be Complex}
\label{sec:Semantic Dependencies Can Be Complex}

Consider this example:

\begin{quote}
	\co{x = horribly_complex(y, z);}
\end{quote}

Here, the presence or absence of a semantic dependency from \co{y} to
\co{x} depends not only on the value of \co{z}, but also the code in a
function that, although single threaded, is horribly complex.

A special case is as follows:

\begin{quote}
	\co{x = y & 0x1 ? do_odd(y) : do_even(y);}
\end{quote}

The key point here is that diferent values might cause almost completely
disjoint code to be executed.

Fortunately, there are now tools that can help.
For example, the SAT-solver-based \co{cbmc} tool
has been used to mechanically verify signicant portions of Linux-kernel
RCU from the C-language source
code~\cite{LihaoLiang2016VerifyTreeRCU,LanceRoy2017CBMC-SRCU}.
Another tool, Nidhugg, which is based on partial-order
reduction, has been used to carry out a similar
verification~\cite{MichalisKokologiannakis2017NidhuggRCU,SMC-TreeRCU,MichalisKokologiannakis2019RCUstatelessModelCheck}.
Both tools can easily check whether or not a given dependency is semantic
for at least some approximate definitions of ``semantic dependency''.
An example use of \co{cbmc} is illustrated in
Appendix~\ref{sec:Evaluating sdep Using cbmc}.

There are also many other tools, but failing that, it is always possible
to fall back to older software-verification tools such as manual
code inspection.

\subsubsection{Implementers and Users Influence Semantic-Dependencies Definition}
\label{sec:Implementers and Users Influence Semantic-Dependencies Definition}

The exact definition of a computer language is subject to some debate,
with standards, implementations, and users all having some degree of
influence~\cite{KayvanMemarian2016DepthOfC-1,KayvanMemarian2016DepthOfC-2},
and each of which is subject to change over time.
Users  and implementers are of course wise to assume that their opinions
might be overridden by those of the standard and, for the users,
especially the implementation.
However, consider the following code:

\begin{quote}
	\co{void foo(char c} \\
	\co{\{} \\
	\co{\ \ \ \ return c + 128;} \\
	\co{\}}
\end{quote}

The standard does not specify whether or not type \co{char} is signed,
leaving that choice to the implementations, which follow the lead
of the architects of a given CPU family.
Therefore, the code above is undefined behavior on systems choosing
signed \co{char} and having 8-bit bytes (so that there is no semantic
dependency from the \co{foo()} function's argument to its return value),
but perfectly well-defined on systems having unsigned \co{char}
(so that there is a semantic dependency).
So score one for the implementers, albeit by conscious choice on the
part of the standards committee.

Except that GCC provides the \co{-funsigned-char} command-line
argument that causes this implementation to treat variables of
type \co{char} as unsigned, regardless of the architects' wishes.
Given this command-line argument, there is always a semantic dependency
from the \co{foo()} function's argument to its return value.
So score one for at least some implementations' users.

Please see Appendix~\ref{sec:User Influence Over Language Semantics}
for more examples of user control over semantics, including semantic
dependencies.

\emph{A definition of sdep drawn strictly from the standard will be
at best an approximation to a definition that is useful in practice.}

\subsubsection{Complex Semantic Dependencies Analysis is a Choice}
\label{sec:Complex Semantic Dependencies Analysis is a Choice}

All of these tools can incur high overhead, especially manual code
inspection.
However, as we will see, the actual C++ implementations themselves need
not use these tools.
Their current analysis is guaranteed to be sufficient, courtesy of the
real-world constraints discussed in the next section, at least assuming
that their analysis is in fact correct.
Furthermore, as we will also see, in some special but commonly occurring
circumstances, there are much simpler methods that incur negligible overhead.

\section{Real-World Constraints}
\label{sec:Real-World Constraints}

Real-world constraints are imposed by the standard, which have been
considered in prior work.
However, in correct real-world C++ implementations, the standard's
abstract machine must be mapped onto real matter and energy.
This mapping has not been considered by prior work, and brings to
bear additional constraints from the laws of physics and from hardware
architecture and design, both of which have been only partially accounted
for in the standard.
One reason for the incomplete accounting for hardware constraints is
that accurate and executable formal descriptions of hardware memory
models did not appear until after the standard was released.
A final set of constraints is imposed by the C++ implementations
themselves, some of which have resulted in non-determinisms within
the standard.\footnote{
	For example, when pre-existing implementations could not agree
	on any specific deterministic handling of side-effects within
	expressions.
	On the other hand, implementer freedom does have significant
	value.}

The following sections discuss these constraints, starting with the
laws of physics, continuing with hardware constraints, continuing
further with constraints imposed by the standard, and culminating
with constraints imposed by the C++ implementations themselves.
An additional section discusses the OOTA-cycle implications for
any tooling that exists separately for these C++ implementations.

\subsection{Laws of Physics}
\label{sec:Laws of Physics}

Evidence to date suggests that the universe is
causal~\cite{Plato360BC-causality},
the speed of light is finite~\cite{OleRoemer1671SpeedOfLight}, and
atoms are of non-zero size~\cite{JeanBaptistePerrin1923AtomSize}.
These fundamental laws of physics are empirical in nature, but
are backed by a great many observations extending back to a time
preceding electronic computers, let alone computer languages that
support concurrency.

The relationship between these three laws of physics and OOTA
cycles is described in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Causality}
\label{sec:Causality}

Plato's ``Timaeus'' notwithstanding, there has been much recent debate
as to whether the universe is in fact causal with cause necessarily
preceding effect.
However, no one has managed to construct a real time-travel machine
or any other apparatus that might result in effect preceding cause,
as discussed at length in Appendix~\ref{sec:Debates on Causality} and 
the URL that it provides.

This paper will therefore assume that effect cannot precede cause in
any real-world computing system.

\subsubsection{Finite Speed of Light}
\label{sec:Finite Speed of Light}

If the speed of light was infinite, then information could be transmitted
at infinite speed, arriving at any destination, no matter how remote,
in zero time.
This situation would permit a load to return the value stored by some
other thread at the exact instant that the store executed, which
would in turn remove propagation delay as a factor preventing
causal loops such as OOTA cycles from forming.

However, all macroscopic measurements to date have shown the speed of
light to be finite.
This paper will therefore assume that the speed of light is finite, and
that the maximum speed at which information can propagate is also finite.

If empirical evidence continues to validate this assumption, it is
not possible to form causal loops based on infinite-speed propagation
of information.

\subsubsection{Non-Zero Sized Atoms}
\label{sec:Non-Zero Sized Atoms}

If atoms were of zero size, a zero-sized computer might be constructed.
In such a computer, even given finite speed of light, information could
propagate among computing elements in zero time.
This situation would also permit a load to return the value stored by
some other thread at the exact instant that the store executed, which
would again in turn remove propagation delay as a factor preventing
causal loops such as OOTA cycles from forming.

However, there has to date been no successful attempt to construct a
zero-sized computing device capable of running non-trivial C++ programs.

This paper will therefore assume that any computing device capable of
running C++ will be of non-zero size, which rules out formation of
causal loops based on zero-size computing systems.

\subsubsection{Laws of Physics: Consequences}
\label{sec:Laws of Physics: Consequences}

These three laws of physics mean that if one thread loads the value
stored by some other thread, that load must have occurred earlier
in global time than did the store.
In other words, the reads-from relation is temporal in nature.

In contrast, the C++11 modification-order relation is atemporal,
because computing systems can and observably do determine the
modification order of a set of concurrent stores long after the fact.
This means that the store that executed earlier in global time
might appear later in the stored-to object's modification
order~\cite{McKenney20xxParallelProgramming}.
The atemporal nature of C++11 modification order is due to the hardware
store-buffer optimizations used by modern multicore systems.

This atemporality is also why cycles are not considered to have
OOTA cycles when at least one link from one thread to the next
involves both threads storing to the same object.
Similarly, cycles having at least link where one thread loads from an
object and the next thread stores to that object are also not considered
to be OOTA cycles.

Current programming-language abstract machines do not capture these
temporal constraints, which makes it more difficult for them to
efficiently rule out OOTA behavior.

\subsection{Hardware Architecture and Design}
\label{sec:Hardware Architecture and Design}

In happy contrast to the situation at the start of the C++11 memory-model
effort, heavily used CPU families now have accurate and executable formal
memory models, all of which prohibit the causal cycles required to form
OOTA cycles.
Even more important, there is clarity on exactly what hardware can and
can not do in the course of speculative execution.
Finally, computation is based on instructions, and instructions require
finite time to execute, even when executed speculatively.

\begin{listing}[tbp]
@@ DisplayLitmus litmus/speculative-store.litmus @@
\caption{Speculated Store and Non-Speculated Load}
\label{lst:Speculated Store and Non-Speculated Load}
\end{listing}

For example, in Listing~\ref{lst:Speculated Store and Non-Speculated Load},
suppose that the storage for \co{x} is located immediately before that
for \co{y[]}.
Suppose further that hardware speculation incorrectly guesses the value
of \co{i} to be -1, so that the speculated store of 42 on line~9 uses
the address of \co{x}.\footnote{
	Yes, \co{y[-1]} is UB, but the CPU neither knows
	nor cares, nor should it.}
Then line~11 can cause the value 42 to be loaded into \co{r1}, when
by the rules of the C++ abstract machine the value must instead be
either zero or one.

Therefore, non-speculative loads are prohibited from loading values from
speculative stores.
And yes, this does mean that hardware can produce OOTA cycles during
speculative execution, but the hardware is required to prevent all such
speculative exection from ever committing.

As a special case of this prohibition, a value stored speculatively must
not be exposed to non-speculative loads from other threads.
In the further special case of multiple hardware threads sharing a core,
one might imagine speculation involving multiple threads.
However, in this case, any squashing of speculation must squash the
full extent of that speculation, across all of the hardware threads
that were involved.

Applying this to Listing~\ref{lst:OOTA Cycle}, because values from
speculative stores cannot be visible to non-speculative loads, lines~10
and~12 cannot be committed until after the load in line~8 completes
and the conditional on line~9 is evaluated non-speculatively.\footnote{
	Alternatively, one could imagine that both the speculation
	and the squashing of failed speculation might span multiple
	threads.
	This might make sense for multiple hardware threads sharing
	a core.}
Similarly, lines~18 and~20 cannot be committed until after lines~16
and~17 complete non-speculatively.

Note that if both legs of the \co{if} statement spanning lines~9-12 were
to store the same value, the implementation would be within its rights
to hoist the store out of that \co{if} statement.
However, in this case, the two stores on lines~10 and~12 are storing
distinct values, preventing the hoisting.

Note also that some architectures provide conditional-move instructions,
which allows line~7 to avoid emitting a conditional branch.
However, such architectures would still treat a store of the
target of the conditional-move instructions as speculative until
such time as the conditional moves (and any loads that they depend
on) complete.

Finally, the prohibition of hardware OOTA applies within a single
multi-threaded core as well as between cores.
This means that for any set of speculative accesses to be committed,
all loads in that set must have been confirmed by corresponding
non-speculative stores.

\subsection{Constraints of the Standard}
\label{sec:Constraints of the Standard}

Because volatile atomics constitute observable
behavior~\cite[\co{intro.abstract}]{ThomasKoeppe2023N4950},
they must be executed in strict accordance with the rules of the abstract
machine.
This means that any volatile atomic operation involving a store
must execute as if all loads whose return values are used to compute
that store's address or value have already returned.
OOTA afficienados will recognize this as a special case of ordering
relaxed loads before relaxed stores, albeit one not requiring
expensive memory-fence instructions on weakly ordered architectures.

Although C++ non-volatile accesses to atomic objects are not observable
behavior, any implementation that restricts its code analysis to a
single thread must assume (unless it can prove otherwise) that a given
relaxed atomic store might affect observable behavior following any
load that returns the value stored.
This assumption does not constrain the implementation to anywhere near
the extent that a volatile relaxed atomic store would, but it does add
significant constrants over those related to non-volatile non-atomic
stores.

For example, non-volatile relaxed atomic accesses are subject to the
memory model.
In particular, implementations must not behave as if the source code has
additional:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Invented atomic stores.
\item	Duplicated atomic stores.
\end{enumerate}

The discussion of these two constraints is followed by a discussion of
when redundant atomic stores may safely be omitted.

The reason that atomic stores cannot be invented is that doing so can
introduce new (and almost certainly undesirable) behaviors that are
forbidden by the abstract machine.
To see this, consider Listing~\ref{lst:Example Invented Store},
a \co{herd7} litmus test that demonstrates such a behavior.
Without line~8, only the values~0 and~3 can be loaded into \co{r1} on
line~13.
With line~8, the additional value~42 can also be loaded into \co{r1}.
The implementation is therefore forbidden from inventing that store of 42
unless it can prove that doing so does not negatively affect the
program's observable behaviors, independently of OOTA cycles.
For example, the implementation might be able to prove that there
are no other accesses to \co{x} at the time of the invented store.

\paragraph{Duplicated Atomic Stores}

\begin{listing}[tbp]
@@ DisplayRunLitmus litmus/duplicated-store.litmus @@
\caption{Example Duplicated Store}
\label{lst:Example Duplicated Store}
\end{listing}

Duplicating atomic stores can also introduce new and undesirable
behaviors.
To see this, consider Listing~\ref{lst:Example Duplicated Store}, a
litmus test that demonstrates such a behavior.
Without line~9, if the value loaded into \co{r1} is 1, then the final value
of \co{x} must be 2.
With line~9, the final value of \co{x} can be 1 even when the
value loaded into \co{r1} is 1.
The implementation is therefore forbidden from duplicating that store of 1
unless it can prove that doing so does not negatively affect the
program's observable behaviors, independently of OOTA cycles.
Again, the implementation might be able to prove that there
are no other accesses to \co{x} at the time of the invented store.

\paragraph{Omitted Redundant Atomic Stores}
In contrast, a pair of back-to-back non-volatile atomic stores to \co{x}
might be executed such that no other thread accesses \co{x}
during the time between those two stores.
This means that, if the implementation acted as if the first store was omitted
from the source, the user would have no way to prove that fact short of
inspecting the assembly code.
In cases where such omissions are undesirable, the user can resort to
volatile atomic stores or to inline assembly\footnote{
	For example, by placing the Linux-kernel \co{barrier()} macro
	between the two stores.
	This macro is an empty GCC \co{asm} that specifies the \co{memory}
	clobber.}
to prevent the implementation from omitting a store.
However, acting as if such a redundant store was omitted from the source
code cannot create an OOTA cycle because any valid execution (OOTA or not)
of the program with the first of a back-to-back pair of non-volatile
relaxed atomic stores omitted is essentially a valid execution of the
program with the store present.

\subsection{C++ Implementations}
\label{sec:C++ Implementations}

C++ implementations execute C++ programs, and use a range of techniques.
For example, many implementations take steps to optimize the code to
be executed.
This optimization presents a trade-off between the time spent optimizing
the code and the time spent actually executing it.
One type of optimization is the identification of non-semantic dependencies
and the replacement of them with simpler computations, up to and including
replacement of arbitrarily complex passages of code with constants.\footnote{
	There are a great many other optimizations, but this paper
	necessarily focuses on semantic dependencies.}

This optimization process may, roughly speaking, be divided into two
activities, analysis of the code and classification of dependencies.
Two sections on these topics are followed by sections on optimizations
and on consequences.

\subsubsection{Code Analysis}
\label{sec:Code Analysis}

As would be expected given the various optimization/execution tradeoffs,
different C++ implementations carry out different degrees of analysis.

First, at one extreme, ``simple implementations'' do absolutely no
analysis beyond that absolutely required to correctly execute the program.

Second, other implementations do local analysis.
This analysis might be on a per-code-path basis, within a single function,
within a single function after inlining, and so forth.

Third, one could imagine implementations whose analysis is restricted to
a thread.
In this case, the analysis stops at loads to objects that were last
stored to by other threads (``rfe''), stores to objects where the next
and/or previous stores in that object's modification order were executed
by other threads (``coe'')), and loads from objects for which the value
returned by a given load was overwritten by some other thread
(``fre'').\footnote{
	See Appendix~\ref{app:Inter-Process Communications} for more
	information on these memory-reference interprocess communications
	links.}

Fourth, one could also imagine implementations whose analysis is
completely unrestricted, up to and including the limiting case where
execution is oracular in nature.
Of course, if we are going to imagine omniscient analysis and oracles,
we can also rely on them to locate any OOTA cycles that might appear
in environments not constrained by the laws of physics, hardware
limitations, and C++ implementation concerns.

However, for more realistic implementations in the third category,
analysis relevant to OOTA cycles begins with loads from objects that were
last stored to by some other thread and ends with stores to objects that
might be loaded by other threads.

If additional inter-thread information is available, the corresponding
constraints may be applied.
For example, if an implementation proves that the values of a pair of
objects are always equal at any time that a given thread might access
them, that implementation could behave as if the that thread's code had
substituted a load from one for a load from the other.

Note that if all of the inter-thread relaxed accesses are volatile,
as they are in the C language, then all of the inter-thread traffic is
observed behavior.
In this case, even omniscient oracular implementations are required
to confine their analyses to within a single thread.

The next section focuses on the key analysis step for OOTA cycles,
namely dependency classification.

\subsubsection{Dependency Classification}
\label{sec:Dependency Classification}

Carrying out this type of optimization requires that the implementation
classify dependencies as maybe semantic or definitely not.
Given the limited resources available, almost all implementations will
choose to approximate sdep, which entails some misclassifications, with
the consequences summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:Semantic-Dependency Classification}.
The first row of the table depicts the case where the implementation
correctly identifies a semantic dependency, and thus exhibits temporal
behavior for the execution at hand of the corresponding code.
The second row depicts the case where the implementation misclassifies
the dependency as non-semantic, which will result in an incorrect
execution.
In this case, the proper course of action is to fix that bug.
The third row depicts the case where the implementation misclassifies
the dependency as semantic, thus missing a chance to optimize.
The resulting execution is nevertheless correct, and is also temporal.
The fourth and final row depicts the case where the implementation
correctly classifies the dependency as non-semantic, in which case
the execution is both correct and atemporal.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|l}
Actual Execution	& Implementation	& Result \\
\hline
sdep			& sdep			& Temporal \\
\cline{2-3}
			& $\neg$sdep		& Fix C++ bug! \\
\hline
$\neg$sde		& sdep			& Temporal \\
\cline{2-3}
			& $\neg$sdep		& Atemporal \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Semantic-Dependency Classification}
\label{tab:Semantic-Dependency Classification}
\end{table}

Note well that in the absence of bugs in the implementation (which
again should be fixed), it is the implementation's classification of
the dependency that dictates whether or not the corresponding execution
is temporal.

\subsubsection{C++ Implementations: Optimization}
\label{sec:C++ Implementations: Optimization}

C++ implementations undertake a wide variety of optimizations, in
some cases taking advantage of nondeterminism and in others applying
the results of code analysis to produce faster code.
The changes can be profound, for example, with large computations being
replaced by simple constants.
Either way, the implementation is behaving as if the original program
had been written more optimally.

In such cases, one option is to carry out analysis of semantic dependencies
on the optimized code.
The seL4 project took this approach to the extreme of analyzing
the binary output~\cite{ThomasSewell2013L4binaryVerification}.

In C++ implementations using compilers, non-determinism of a given
(post-optimization) code path is ``frozen'' into the resulting binary,
which greatly simplifies analysis of semantic dependencies.
Other c++ implementations (for example, those using interpreters or JITs)
might need to directly model any nondeterminism.
This latter situation might motivate additional C++ projects to ban
nondeterminism in favor of portable code.

Another question is how to prove that a given optimization is valid.
This has been a hard question in the past, and is likely to remain so
both for sequential and concurrent programs.
The consequences of using an invalid optimization can be quite severe,
and the evidence thus far indicates that OOTA cycles are not a bit issue.
Nevertheless, a proof that the same value is always stored implies a
proof that there is no semantic dependency to that relaxed atomic store,
and thus no chance of that store participating in an OOTA cycle.

\subsubsection{C++ Implementations: Consequences}
\label{sec:C++ Implementations: Consequences}

Given a correct C++ implementation, a given store will either be
executed as if is was semantically dependent on a given prior load or
not.
In the former case on a real-world implementation, a non-negative interval
of time will elapse between the load and the store, and in the latter
case, that load-store pair cannot possibly be a member of an OOTA cycle.

Of course, dependencies can be separately analyzed, and such analysis
might show that one of the dependencies that the implementation treated
as a semantic dependency was in fact non-semantic.
And this is a belt-and-suspenders situation:
The corresponding load-store pair cannot be a member of an OOTA cycle,
and a non-negative interval of time will elapse between the load and
the store.

\subsection{Semantic Dependencies and Tooling}
\label{sec:Semantic Dependencies and Tooling}

Where a C++ implementation's primary function is to correctly execute
a C++ program, the function of tooling is often to evaluate properties
of possible executions of that same program.
This difference in function results in different sensitivities to
sdep misclassifications, as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:Semantic-Dependency Classification For Tools}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|l}
Actual Execution	& Tooling		& Result \\
\hline
sdep			& sdep			& Temporal \\
\cline{2-3}
			& $\neg$sdep		& False Positive (Warning?) \\
\hline
$\neg$sdep		& sdep			& False Negative (Warning?) \\
\cline{2-3}
			& $\neg$sdep		& Atemporal \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Semantic-Dependency Classification For Tools}
\label{tab:Semantic-Dependency Classification For Tools}
\end{table}

Any misclassification will result in either a false positive or
a false negative, except that many tools give some indication of a
misclassification, for example, printing a warning message indicating
that the code is too complex for it to analyze.
Some projects would choose to restructure the code in such cases on the
grounds that code that is difficult for an automated tool to understand
is likely also being misunderstood by its all-too-human developers.

One advantage that tools often have over C++ implementations is the
ability to devote much more computational power to the problem at hand.
In fact, some tools respond to excessive complexity by consuming all
available CPU and memory, which can also be interpreted as a good and
sufficient warning message.

However, there is an important special case for tools that are closely
associated with a C++ implementation.
Such tools can simply use that implementation's classification of
dependencies as semantic on the one hand or non-semantic on the other,
whether by working with that implementation's intermediate representations,
binaries produced by that implementation, or by tracing the program's
execution.
While taking this approach sacrifices significant generality, it has the
significant benefit of greatly reducing the cost of dependency analysis,
potentially all the way down to zero.

\section{How to Form an OOTA Cycle?}
\label{sec:How to Form an OOTA Cycle?}

Rather than look at how to prevent an implementation from forming
an OOTA cycle, this section instead looks at how to form one.
This will lead to the conclusion that a correct real-world C++
implementation cannot form an OOTA cycle.

Again, an OOTA cycle consists of loads from other threads' stores where
a given store's address or value depends on the value returned by
the corresponding thread's prior load.
All of the links from one thread to the next are reads-from links, which
are temporal in nature, that is, a given store must execute earlier in
global time than any load from that stored-to object that returns the
value stored.

But it is also the case that an OOTA cycle must have at least one link
that goes backwards in time.
Given that the inter-thread links are temporal with a give store preceding
any load returning the value stored, the only possible candidate atemporal
links are those confined to a given thread.
This in turn requires that a store that depends on an earlier load
be executed earlier in time than that load.
The two ways that this can happen are when the implementation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Is able to prove the location and value of the store.
\item	Guesses the location and value of the store and has some means
	to take corrective action should any guess prove incorrect.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these possibilities is discussed in the next sections.
followed by a section on the possibility of flattening a multithreaded
program into a single thread.

\subsection{Implementation Proves Value}
\label{sec:Implementation Proves Value}

Implementation can sometimes prove the location and value of a given
store.
For example, if the value loaded is multiplied by zero, the result
is known to be zero, so that the store can proceed prior to the load.
But in this case, there is no way that the value returned from
the load that can affect the value stored.
Therefore, that store cannot possibly take part in an OOTA cycle.

\subsection{Implementation Guesses at Value}
\label{sec:Implementation Guesses at Value}

Hardware speculative execution is commonplace, and permits the
hardware to guess at values, squashing the speculation if any
of the guesses prove incorrect.
But in this case, a given store is not committed until all guesses that
this store depends on have been confirmed, and thus no uncommitted store
is visible to any other thread.
Therefore, any hardware speculation that results in OOTA cycles is doomed
to be squashed an discarded, and by design, even on weakly ordered
systems~\cite{ARMv7A:2010,ARMv8A:2017,PowerISA2.07-2013}.
This same constraint applies to software, which might use compare-and-swap
loops or hardware transactional memory to confirm guesses.

Either way, the need to wait for guesses to be confirmed before committing
stores prevents those stores from becoming visible prior to the
completion of any loads that those stores depend on.

\subsection{But What About Flattening?}
\label{sec:But What About Flattening?}

The concept of flattening multiple threads into a single thread is
tantalizing, especially given the large cache-miss penalties inherent
to large multicore systems, which can have many sockets containing
thousands of CPUs.
One might object to the whole concept of flattening as an
optimization given the difficulty inherent in avoiding deadlocks
and other hazards.
Nevertheless, it is only reasonable to ask whether flattening can
result in OOTA cycles.
As we will see, the answer is ``no''.

The reason for this answer is that any fully flattened program will be
single threaded, which implies that each of its atomic load operations
will return the last value stored to that same object in sequenced-before
order (or the initial value if there is no such store).
Thus, any sequence of loads and stores must have a first operation and
a last operation, and the last operation cannot affect the first
operation.
Therefore, cycles cannot possibly form in a flattened program,
which in turn implies that OOTA cycles cannot form.

\subsection{Correct Implementations Cannot Form OOTA Cycles}
\label{sec:Correct Implementations Cannot Form OOTA Cycles}

This section has shown that an implementation that correctly
handles the memory model, observable behavior, and the as-if rule
cannot form OOTA cycles when running on real systems in this
universe.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

This paper has added temporal reasoning to OOTA analysis of the C++
memory model.
This work shows that correct real-world C++ implementations are inherently
incapable of producing OOTA cycles.

Therefore, if your C++ implementation produces OOTA cycles, you have bugs.
And you need to fix those bugs, regardless of whether they are in your
C++ implementation, your hardware, or your alternate universe.

\section{OOTA-Related Litmus Tests}
\label{app:OOTA-Related Litmus Tests}

This appendix evaluates a number of OOTA-related litmus tests.
The evaluations are carried out using the \co{herd7} tool and also
using manual analysis.
The manual analysis uses the informal rule that a semantic dependency
exists between a given relaxed atomic load and store on any execution
where a different value loaded would change the address stored to, the
value stored, or the whether or not that store would be executed in
the first place.
Producing a precise formal statement of this rule turns out to be quite
challenging.
For but one example, identical stores are fungible, so that if all
executions always execute one of several equivalently positioned stores
having identical addresses and values, there is no semantic dependency
from any load to any of those stores~\cite{Howells2009membartxt}.

Appendix~\ref{app:Litmus Tests from “Causality Test Cases"}
evaluates the obligatory litmus tests from the JMM Causality Test
Cases, and
Appendix~\ref{app:Additional Litmus Tests}
evaluates some additional litmus tests that affected our thinking or
otherwise gave us pause.

\subsection{Litmus Tests from “Causality Test Cases"}
\label{app:Litmus Tests from “Causality Test Cases"}

These tests might be two decades old, but they are still quite
relevant.

\subsubsection{Causality Test Case 1}
\label{app:Causality Test Case 1}

Listing~\ref{lst:Causality Test Case 1}
shows causality test case 1, for which the \co{r1 == r2 == 1} result
is to be allowed.
The \co{herd7} tool finds this litmus test's cycle, even without the
inter-thread analysis, because C++ does not respect control dependencies
to relaxed atomic stores.

\begin{listing}[tbp]

Implementations that can prove that the value of \co{x} is always
non-negative can also prove that there is no semantic dependency between
\co{P0()}'s load from \co{x} on line~8 to its store to \co{y} on line~10,
that is, no matter which of the possible values is loaded from \co{x},
the value 1 will always be stored to \co{y}.

Less-omniscient implementations, including those whose code analysis
is restricted to a thread, would need to act as if there was in fact a
semantic dependency.

Even omniscient implementations will observe a semantic dependency from
\co{P1()}'s load from \co{y} on line~14 to its store to \co{x} on line~15.

Either way, there is no OOTA cycle, with omniscient implementations
having no cycle at all, and other implementations retaining the
non-semantic dependency.

\subsubsection{Causality Test Case 2}
\label{app:Causality Test Case 2}

Listing~\ref{lst:Causality Test Case 2}
shows causality test case 2, for which the \co{r1 == r2 == r3 == 1} result
is to be allowed.
The \co{herd7} tool finds this cycle, and does not flag it as an OOTA cycle.

Because \co{P0()}'s loads from \co{x} on lines~8 and~9 are unordered,
an implementation can act as if the source code loaded from \co{x} only
once and assigned the returned value to both \co{r1} and \co{r2}.\footnote{
	But not in C, where relaxed atomic operations are volatile,
	and thus observable behavior.}
The implementation could then prove that the condition on line~10
would always evaluate to \co{true}, and act as if the source code had
unconditionally executed the relaxed store to \co{y} on line~11.
The implementation could then act as if the resulting relaxed accesses
to \co{x} and \co{y} appeared in reverse order, at which point
\co{P0()}'s store to \co{y} could be read by \co{P1()} load so that
\co{P1()} stored 1 to \co{x}, thus resulting in \co{P1()} loading
that 1 from \co{x}.

Note that \co{P1()} has a trivial semantic dependency from its load
from \co{y} on line~15 to its store to \co{x} on line~16.

If \co{P0()}'s loads from \co{x} are fused, there is no cycle,
otherwise the preserved non-semantic dependency prevents an
OOTA cycle from forming on correct real-world implementations.

\subsubsection{Causality Test Case 3}
\label{app:Causality Test Case 3}

Listing~\ref{lst:Causality Test Case 3}
shows causality test case 3, for which the \co{r1 == r2 == r3 == 1} result
is to be allowed.
The \co{herd7} tool finds this cycle, and does not flag it as an OOTA cycle.

The analysis from Section~\ref{app:Causality Test Case 2}
applies here, including the difference in volatility between C and C++
atomics.
Although the addition of \co{P2} allows sequentially consistent executions
where \co{P0()}'s two loads from \co{x} might return different values,
it does not change the fact that those two loads can be merged.

\co{P1()} has a straightforward semantic dependency between its
relaxed atomic load and relaxed atomic store.
However, suppose that \co{P0()}'s load from \co{x} on line~8 returns
the value 42.
In that case, the second load on line~11 can be fused with the first,
so that it also returns the value 42.
On the other hand, if the load on line~8 returns some other value, then
line~10 will store the value 42 to \co{x}, and then the load on line~11
can be elided\footnote{
	In C++, but not in C due to atomics being volatile.}
in favor of using the value 42 stored by line~10.

Either way, the value of \co{r1} will be the constant 42.
Therefore, the loads from \co{x} cannot affect the store on line~17,
so there is no semantic dependency.
This allows that store to \co{y} to be moved to the very beginning of
\co{P0()}, thus allowing a correct real-world C++ implementation to

the store to and load from \co{y}.
In addition, the value stored to \co{y} is forced to be at least the
value 17, and the value stored to \co{z} is forced to be at most the
value 17.
This of course means that the store to \co{z} must always be the value
17, and that a C++ implementation could prove this by examining \co{P0()}
in isolation given that it is also legal for a C++ implementation
to replace the value loaded from \co{y} with the value just stored.\footnote{
	This is not an option in C because atomic operations are volatile,
	and thus observed behavior.}

In the confines of the C++ abstract machine (omitting the no-OOTA
restriction), this allows a value-17 OOTA cycle, courtesy of the fact
that C++ respects neither control nor data dependencies.
However, the \co{herd7} tool does not identify this cycle, perhaps due
to its restrictions on its handling of arithmetic on OOTA values.

In a real-world implementation that proves that the value 17 is always
stored to \co{z}, there is no semantic dependency to
\co{P0()}'s store to \co{z}, but there is to all of the other relaxed
atomic stores.
On the other hand, if the implementation does not prove the value
stored to \co{z}, there will be a global-time delay between each of
\co{P0()}'s loads and its store to \co{z}, preventing a value-17 OOTA
cycle from forming.

Either way, the value-17 OOTA cycle cannot occur in a correct real-world
C++ implementation.
Yes, an implementation that proves that the value 17 is always
stored to \co{z} can satisfy the \co{exists} clause, but because
there is no semantic dependency to \co{P0()}'s store to \co{z},
this is not an OOTA cycle.

But what if we chose to define an OOTA cycle as (sdep $\cup$ rf) instead
of (sdep $\cup$ rfe)?

\caption{Why rfe Instead of Tried-And-True rf When z=17?}
\label{lst:Why rfe Instead of Tried-And-True rf When z=17?}

In that case, it would be necessary to separately consider the dependency
from \co{P0()}'s load from \co{x} and \co{y} and that from its load
from \co{y} and its store to \co{z}.
The problem with this is shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:Why rfe Instead of Tried-And-True rf When z=17?},
which shows an equivalent program given the knowledge that the value~17
will always be stored to \co{z}.
Because all atomic operations are relaxed and because C++ does not
respect control dependencies, the store to \co{z} can be moved up
to the very beginning of \co{P0()}.
This transformation causes the rfi link associated with \co{y} to
go backwards in time, which is perfectly legitimate in this case,
but which makes defining OOTA cycles in terms of (sdep $\cup$ rf)
problematic.

Again, in C, the load from \co{y} cannot be removed because it is
volatile, and thus observable behavior.
C++ could remove that load, but we left it in to demonstrate the all-17s
outcome.

This example demonstrates why OOTA cycles must be defined in terms
of (sdep $\cup$ rfe), or in \co{herd7} nomenclature,
\co{acyclic(sdep; rfe)}.

\section{Aside on Undefined Behavior}
\label{app:Aside on Undefined Behavior}

The combination of OOTA cycles and UB has proven especially
challenging~\cite{DavidGoldblatt2019NoElegantOOTAfix}.

\subsection{Alignment-Based Undefined Behavior}
\label{sec:Alignment-Based Undefined Behavior}

The example shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:Alignment-Based Undefined Behavior (P1916R0)}
(taken from P1916R0) is especially instructive.

\begin{listing}[tbp]
\begin{verbatim}
 1 std::atomic<int> y;
 2 template <typename T>
 3 void t1() {
 4   long long r1 = x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
 5   if (r1 % 4 == 0)
 6     y.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
 7   *(T*)r1 = *(T*)r1;
 8 }
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Alignment-Based Undefined Behavior (P1916R0)}
\label{lst:Alignment-Based Undefined Behavior (P1916R0)}
\end{listing}

Because the compiler often assumes that UB cannot happen, it might
look at line~7 and conclude that the value of \co{r1} necessarily
corresponded to an address aligned per the requirements of type \co{T}.
If that type's alignment was larger than four bytes, the compiler could
then replace the condition in line~5 with \co{true}, which would mean
that there was no semantic dependency from the load of \co{x} to the
store of \co{y}.

Except that the developer might have knowingly carried out a misaligned
access, for example, to test an alignment trap handler or because the
system on which this code was to run was known to gracefully handle
misaligned accesses.

\begin{listing}[tbp]
\begin{verbatim}
 1 std::atomic<int> y;
 2 template <typename T>
 3 void t1() {
 4   long long r1 = x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
 5   if (r1 % 4 == 0)
 6     y.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
 7   std::observable();
 8   *(T*)r1 = *(T*)r1;
 9 }
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Alignment-Based Undefined Behavior Fix}
\label{lst:Alignment-Based Undefined Behavior Fix}
\end{listing}

However, in that case, the developer is stepping outside the bounds
of the standard.
It would be good to have some way for the developer to get the job
done without confusing the compiler, thus separating OOTA-cycle and
UB concerns.
One approach is to use the \co{std::observable()} function
that has been proposed to the C++ standards
committee~\cite{DavisHerring2021P1494R2}.
This function would blocks backwards-propagating UB.
Then this example could be rewritten as shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:Alignment-Based Undefined Behavior Fix},
with the asm on line~7 preventing the compiler from assuming that line~8
is guaranteed to be executed, thus preventing the compiler from
applying any lessons that it might learn from line~8 to line~5.

% Clean up <200b> in vim: ":%s/\%u200b//g"

There are a number of ways to implement \co{std::observable()},
for example, a new \co{"mightnotreturn"} GCC asm clobber, a call to an empty
function that is invisible to the compiler, and a GCC goto asm that the
compiler cannot prove falls through.

\subsection{Unreachability-Based Undefined Behavior}
\label{sec:Unreachability-Based Undefined Behavior}

This section attempts to apply the lessons
of Appendix~\ref{sec:Unreachability-Based Undefined Behavior} to
Goldblatt's unreachability-UB example.

Inserting \co{std::observable()} at line~12
as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:Alignment-Based Undefined Behavior Fix}
avoids confusing the compiler into assuming that the value of \co{local}
must necessarily be zero.

\begin{listing}[tbp]
\begin{verbatim}
 1 // UB if this function is ever called.
 2 [[noreturn]]
 3 inline void unreachable() {
 4   return;
 5 }
 6 void t1() {
 7   r1 = x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
 8   int local = (r1 & 1);
 9   if (local == 0)
10     y.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
11   if (local != 0) {
12     std::observable();
13     // If we get here, UB.
14     unreachable();
15   }
16 }
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Unreachability-Based Undefined Behavior Fix}
\label{lst:Unreachability-Based Undefined Behavior Fix}
\end{listing}

By the same reasoning, Goldblatt's \co{misbhave} example that
also involves unreachability can also be addressed through insertion
of the proposed \co{std::observable()}.

\section{Evaluating sdep Using \co{cbmc}}
\label{sec:Evaluating sdep Using cbmc}

This section demonstrates the evaluation of sdep using
the C Bounded Model Checker
(\co{cbmc})~\cite{EdmundClarke2004CBMC}.
This tool takes a smallish C program as input and constructs a logic
expression representing that program.
The logic expression's variables represent bits in the program's inputs
and state, and the result of that logic expression is \co{true} if that
program has a bug, for example, if it is possible for that C program to
trigger an assertion or execute an out-of-bounds array reference.
The tool then hands this expression to a SAT solver, and if this solver
finds a satisfying set of values, the tool uses that set to provide
the execution path to the bug.

19 }
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Code for cbmc-Based Evaluation of sdep}
\label{lst:Code for cbmc-Based Evaluation of sdep}
\end{listing}

One way to answer this question is to create a C program
(see Listing~\ref{lst:Code for cbmc-Based Evaluation of sdep})
that runs the \co{P0()} process's code twice with arbitrary inputs
(the loop spanning lines~6-17) and asserts that the results of
each iteration be equal (line~18).

Running this with:

\begin{quote}
	\scriptsize
	\co{cbmc -DCBMC cbmc/sdep-quadratic.c}
\end{quote}

gives the result \co{VERIFICATION FAILED}.
This indicates that there are different values of \co{x} and \co{limit}
that yield different values of \co{y}, that is, that there can be
a semantic dependency.

However, $x^2 + 2x + 2$ has a minimum value of 1 at $x=-1$, so
forcing \co{limit} to (say) zero should eliminate this static
dependency:

\begin{quote}
	\scriptsize
	\co{cbmc -DCBMC -DLOAD_CONSTANT=0 cbmc/sdep-quadratic.c}
\end{quote}

But this also gives the result \co{VERIFICATION FAILED}.
One reason for this is that this program does 32-bit computer arithmetic,
and is thus subject to wraparound.
Limiting the value of \co{x} to 46,339 prevents wraparound:

\begin{quote}
	\scriptsize
	\co{cbmc -DCBMC -DLOAD_CONSTANT=0 -DLOAD_LIMITS=46339 cbmc/sdep-quadratic.c}
\end{quote}

And this yields \co{VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL}, indicating that there
is no semantic dependency in this case.
This is to be expected because the specified value of zero for \co{limit}
is smaller than the minimum of the quadratic expression, so that the
value stored to \co{y} is always zero.
Specifying \co{-DLOAD_CONSTANT=1} also yields \co{VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL}
because this value is equal to that minimum, so that the value stored to
\co{y} is always 1.
However, specifying any larger value (for example, \co{-DLOAD_CONSTANT=2})
yields \co{VERIFICATION FAILED} because the value assigned to \co{y}
might be either 1 or 2, indicating that a semantic dependency exists.

This situation underscores the point that the existance of a semantic
dependency can be a property of a particular execution rather than a
universal property of the code itself.

There are numerous other tools that can be used, up to and including
manual inspection, but \co{cbmc} is readily available and easy to
use.\footnote{

\section{Inter-Process Communications}
\label{app:Inter-Process Communications}

This section more clearly defines the ``coe'', ``fre'', and ``rfe''
types of interprocess communication (also collectively called ``links'')
and gives evidence on the temporal qualities of these different types.

First, context.
The final ``e'' in all three acronyms stands for ``external'' as opposed
to within-thread communication (``coi'', ``fri'', and ``rfi'') and as
also opposed to all communication, whether inter-thread or intra-thread
(``co'', ``fr'', and ``rf'').

Next, definitions:

\begin{description}
\item[coe]
	Coherency (external), which connects a store to any other store
	to that same object that overwrites either the first store's
	value or that overwrites some later value.
\item[fre]
	From-read (external), which connects a load to any other store
	object that overwrites either the value that the load returned
	or that overwrites some later value.
\item[rfe]
	Reads-from (external), which connects a store to any load from
	that same object that returns the value stored.
\end{description}

\begin{figure}[tb]

\resizebox{4in}{!}{\includegraphics{ipc}}
\caption{IPC Diagram for coe, fre, and rfe}
\label{fig:IPC Diagram for coe, fre, and rfe}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Thirdly, Figure~\ref{fig:IPC Diagram for coe, fre, and rfe} illustrates
the coe, fre, fri, and rfe links for four threads with time advancing
from the top to the bottom of the figure.  Starting with coe, even though
Thread~1's store was later in global time than that of Thread~0, that of
Thread~1 came first in coe order, followed by those of Threads~2 and ~3.
There is thus a coe link from Thread~1's store to every other store,
from Thread~0's store to those of Threads~2 and~3, and from Thread~2's
store to that of Thread~3.

Thread~3's load reads the value stored by Thread~0's store, so there is
an rfe link from that store to that load.  There is also an fre link from
that load to Thread~2's store and an fri link to Thread~3's later store.
Note that this fre link goes backwards in time.

Finally, there might be a desire for hard evidence that coe and fre
links really can go backwards in time.
We provide this evidence on x86 to demonstrate that these effects
are not confined to weakly ordered systems.
This system is a laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-10885H CPU @ 2.40GHz,
having a single socket with 8~cores, each having a pair of hardware
threads.
The code generating this data may be found in the \path{CodeSamples/cpu}
directory of the
perfbook~\cite{McKenney2018ParallelProgramming-2018-12-08a}.\footnote{
	\co{git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulmck/perfbook.git}}

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{3in}{!}{\includegraphics{coe-sh-out}}
\caption{On x86, coe Links Are Atemporal}
\label{fig:On x86, coe Links Are Atemporal}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:On x86, coe Links Are Atemporal}
shows the results of 15 of the laptop's hardware threads simultaneously
storing their identifying integer (ranging from 0 to 14) to a shared
variable, then repeatedly doing timestamped reads from that variable.
The x-axis displays time in TSC periods, each of which is about 0.417~ns
in duration.
The y-axis shows the number of distinct opinions that the hardware
threads have as a function of time, a number that is frequently rather
larger than one.
The backwards-in-time coe link from Thread~1 to Thread~0 in
Figure~\ref{fig:IPC Diagram for coe, fre, and rfe}
is therefore entirely plausible.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{5in}{!}{\includegraphics{coe-out-1}}

\caption{On Power5, coe Links Are Also Partially Ordered}
\label{fig:On Power5, coe Links Are Also Partially Ordered}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

However, Figure~\ref{fig:On x86, coe Links Are Partially Ordered}
shows that the order of reads of each value at each thread are
consistent with a number of global orders, as required.
Figure~\ref{fig:On Power5, coe Links Are Also Partially Ordered}
shows a rather more elaborate partial order from a Power5
system~\cite{McKenney2018ParallelProgramming-2018-12-08a}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{3in}{!}{\includegraphics{fre-sh-out}}
\caption{On x86, fre Links Are Atemporal}
\label{fig:On x86, fre Links Are Atemporal}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:On x86, fre Links Are Atemporal}
plots a histogram of the elapsed time from the last load to return the
old value to the store that provided the new value.
Note well that most of the data falls into negative time, that is to say,
the last load of the old value executes about 50 timestamp periods (about
20~nanoseconds) \emph{after} the store that overwrote that same old value.
That is, fre links can and do go backwards in time.
This corresponds to the fre link between Thread~3 an Thread~2 depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:IPC Diagram for coe, fre, and rfe}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{3in}{!}{\includegraphics{rfe-sh-out}}
\caption{On x86, rfe Links Are Temporal}
\label{fig:On x86, rfe Links Are Temporal}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:On x86, rfe Links Are Temporal}
plots a histogram of the elapsed time from a store of a new value
to the first load of that new value.
Note well that all of the data falls into positive time, indicating
that rfe links always go forward in time, as those familiar with
computer hardware and the laws of physics would expect.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{4in}{!}{\includegraphics{coe}}
\resizebox{4in}{!}{\includegraphics{fre}}
\resizebox{4in}{!}{\includegraphics{rfe}}
\caption{Propagation Delay and Temporal Properties of coe, fre, and rfe}
\label{fig:Propagation Delay and Temporal Properties of coe, fre, and rfe}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:Propagation Delay and Temporal Properties of coe, fre, and rfe}
shows how the temporal properties of coe, fre, and rfe are explained
by propagation delay.
In the case of coe, the two stores take time to propagate across the
system, and their ordering can and is decided after the fact.
In the case of fre, the store again takes time to propagate across
the system, and so a load might execute later in global time than
did the store, but not late enough to return that store's value.
In the case of rfe, the load cannot return a given store's value until
the value has propagated to that part of the system executing that load.

And this is exactly why the C++ memory model guarantees ordering from
rfe links but not the coe and fre links for relaxed accesses in the
absence of other ordering from stronger atomic memory accesses or
\co{atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst}.

\section{User Influence Over Language Semantics}
\label{sec:User Influence Over Language Semantics}

As noted earlier, the exact definition of a computer language is subject
to some debate, with standards, implementations, and users all having
some degree of
influence~\cite{KayvanMemarian2016DepthOfC-1,KayvanMemarian2016DepthOfC-2},
and each of which is subject to change over time.
It is natural to dismiss user influence when compared to the text of
standards or the code in implementations, but both are subject to
change and do change over time.
The implementation is especially subject to change, for example,
consider the following command line used to build the Linux kernel's
\co{kernel/rcu/tree.c} C-language source file:

~\\

	}
}

We do not propose to explain all of these, and sufficiently motivated
readers can avail themselves of the GCC documentation.
We instead look at representative members of several categories.

The \co{-funsigned-char} causes type \co{char} to be unsigned, which
overrides per-architecture defaults, some of which treat \co{char}
as signed and others as \co{unsigned}.
This choice prevents a class of bugs, and also allows the kernel to make
reliable use of the uppermost bit of variables of type \co{char}.
It also affects the definition of ``semantic dependency'' by changing
the arithmetic proporties of this type.
In theory, the standard could specify the signedness of \co{char},
but presumably the variety of existing practice in the 1980s prevented
this from being done.

The \co{-mno-sse} prevents GCC from making use of the SSE hardware.
This is done for performance reasons, as it avoids the overhead of
saving and restoring the state of this hardware when switching between
user and kernel contexts.
Similarly, the \co{-mcmodel=kernel} causes the kernel binary to be
placed in the uppermost 2GB of the address space, again reducing
the overhead of switching between user and kernel contexts.
These are cases where the standard does not specify anything, nor
should it.

The \co{-fpatchable-function-entry=16,16} causes GCC to emit 16
\co{nop} instructions at the beginning of each function, with
the function's entry point being just after this string of \co{nop}
instructions.
The resulting buffers are used by the Linux-kernel tracing infrastructure
which is in turn used for debugging, performance measurement, and
monitoring.
This is again clearly outside of the scope of the standard.

The \co{-fstack-protector-strong} causes GCC to emit code that provides
some protection against some clases of attacks based on buffer overflows.
One could rightly argue code should simply avoid ever overflowing buffers,
but things like memory allocators and userspace memory accesses must
use code that can be difficult to distinguish from buffer overflows.
It is not clear that the ever-increasing variety of attacks should
affect the standard.

The \co{-fno-strict-overflow} causes GCC to act as if signed integer
overflow is defined behavior.
Note well that this command-line option also affects the definition of
``semantic dependency''.
This might be a controversial choice, and another option would be to add
a new set of signed integer types to the standard for which overflow is
defined as wrapping, similar to the situation with unsigned integers.

The \co{-Werror=strict-prototypes} causes GCC to warn if old-style
non-ANSI function prototypes are used.
This helps avoid certain classes of bugs.
Warnings are by design outside of the scope of the standard.

In other words, user preference can exert a non-trivial influence over
language semantics, and in particular can affect some aspects of the
definition of ``semantic dependency''.

\section{Debates on Causality}
\label{sec:Debates on Causality}

This Appendix is provided as a service to readers who want to know more
about the ongoing debates on causality, provided by the combined efforts
of Bard, Chat-GPT, and Bing Co-Pilot.
References may be found here:

}

The concept of causality, the idea that events are caused by preceding
events in a predictable and consistent manner, is fundamental to many
scientific theories and our understanding of the world.
However, when it comes to the universe as a whole, particularly at the
most fundamental levels such as in quantum physics or the origins of
the universe, the idea of strict causality can become more complex.

In classical physics, causality is often described in terms of
deterministic laws, where events are determined by prior causes.
But at the quantum level, the behavior of particles can be probabilistic
and uncertain.
Quantum mechanics introduces a level of randomness and uncertainty that
challenges our classical notions of causality.

Additionally, when considering the origin of the universe (the Big Bang),
the laws of physics as we understand them break down at extremely high
densities and temperatures.
The conditions at the very beginning of the universe might not conform
to our classical understanding of causality, and some theories suggest
that time itself might have begun with the Big Bang, making it difficult
to define causality in a traditional sense within such a framework.

On the one hand, there is a strong case to be made that the universe
is causal.
Our understanding of physics is based on the principle of causality,
which states that every event has a cause.
This principle has been incredibly successful in explaining and predicting
the behavior of the universe at large scales.
Additionally, our own personal experience seems to confirm causality.
We constantly observe events being caused by other events, and we have
no reason to believe that this is an illusion.

However, there are also some challenges to the idea of a perfectly
causal universe.
One challenge comes from quantum mechanics, which suggests that some
events may be fundamentally non-causal.
For example, the collapse of a wave function in quantum mechanics seems
to be a random event, with no underlying cause.
Additionally, our understanding of the universe's origins is still
very limited.
We don't know whether the Big Bang itself had a cause, or whether it
was simply the beginning of everything.

In summary, while causality is a fundamental concept in our understanding
of the universe, its application and implications can become more complex,
especially at the quantum level and regarding the origin of the universe.
There are ongoing debates and explorations within physics and philosophy
about the nature of causality in these contexts.

% @@@ TODO:

% Objections:
% "Atomic operations are not observable behavior."
%	They are for volatile atomic objects.  Plus an implementation
%	whose analysis is confined to a thread would need to assume
%	that any atomic store might lead to observable behavior in some
%	other thread.  An implementation with a global view must preserve
%	observable behavior regardless of OOTA cycles.	Plus if an OOTA
%	cycle does not affect observable behavior, who cares?
% "The C++ abstract machine is independent of the laws of physics."
%	That might be, but any real implementation of that abstract
%	machine will be governed by those laws.
% "Real hardware can exhibit OOTA, as exemplified by audio feedback."
%	Such hardware does not run C++.  Also, audio feedback is more
%	closely approximated by a loop calculating sound intensity than
%	by OOTA, especially given that you must include the audio
%	properties of the enclosing space in analyzing the feedback loop.

% Additional snark:
% "This work reduces the problem of OOTA analysis to that of sequential
%	program analysis.  If you expect better verification of concurrent
%	code than of sequential code, you are in an intellectual state
%	of sin."
% "Forcing relaxed loads to be ordered before subsequent relaxed stores
%	is an expensive no-op."
% "So you don't want to learn concurrency?  Then I can only suggest
%	that you either move further up the stack or take early
%	retirement."  Note that that C++ committee's concurrency
%	expertise has grown beyond recognition over the past 15 years.

% One-pager:
% Threats to validity:
% Speed of light might not always be finite.
% Zero-sized atoms might be discovered.
% It might be possible to propagate information at infinite velocity
%	despite the finite speed of light.
% It might be possible to violate causality.
% Hardware and compiler bugs might result in OOTA.
% ML hallucination might convince people that OOTA is OK.
